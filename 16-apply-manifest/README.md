# Apply Manifest

TODO: fix this up and check if it works :)

To apply the manifest type ```puppet apply <somemanifest.pp```.

The results will look like:

TODO: Make reference to --trace and --debug here

We're done...

Perhaps include steps on using the create and delete methods of the provider too?

TODO: Add links to next steps - link to relevant talks from puppet conf about T&Ps, perhaps include links to blog posts about T&P, also link to tasks hands on lab.
