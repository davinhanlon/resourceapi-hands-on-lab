# Create Module

In this exercise you will create your first module.

Navigate to a directory in which you wish to place your code. Type ```pdk new module <module_name>```. You will then be presented with a questionnaire. The answers to this questionnaire will result in a module skeleton being created with a metadata.json file created matching the answers of the questionnaire.
