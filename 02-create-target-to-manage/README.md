TODO

Create an application that has a Rest API - get some data and set some data.

Needs to be easy to set up, create an account, because all steps must be in the tutorial.

Must be real, in that there should be a simulator or emulator that allows the results to be easily displayed for instant feedback.

Alternative would be to have a docker container thatâ€™s running a web app with a REST api that participants can communicate with. Creates a dependency on Docker, but that could be overcome by providing the web application in a repo of its own, if people objected to Docker.

Will be using Nest for the initial pass of this, just because it's set up for me. Not appropriate for the lab though.
